### 1. Introduction

The NettyRPC framework extends the basic RPC framework by leveraging **Netty** for asynchronous, non-blocking IO operations and **Kryo** for fast serialization and deserialization of Java objects. This framework allows the client to invoke remote server methods seamlessly. The integration of Netty enhances the performance and scalability of the server by handling high-throughput connections efficiently, while Kryo improves serialization speed and reduces data size.

### 2. Architecture Overview

The architecture of NettyRPC includes:
- **Client Proxy**: Converts client method calls into `RpcRequest` objects and sends them to the server.
- **Netty Server**: Uses Netty to manage connections and process client requests asynchronously.
- **Kryo Serialization**: Efficiently serializes and deserializes `RpcRequest` and `RpcResponse` objects, reducing overhead.
- **Thread Pool on Server**: Processes multiple client requests concurrently, improving scalability and resource management.

### 3. Core Components

#### 3.1 `ClientProxy`
Located at: `src/main/java/rpc/v1/netty/client/proxy/ClientProxy.java`

- **Purpose**: Acts as a dynamic proxy for client-side interface calls, intercepting method calls and creating `RpcRequest` objects that are sent to the server.
- **Key Methods**:
    - `invoke`: Captures the method call details, packages them in an `RpcRequest`, and sends them to the server. It returns the `RpcResponse` data back to the caller.
    - `getProxy`: Generates a proxy instance for the specified interface, allowing seamless client-side method calls.

#### 3.2 `RpcRequest` and `RpcResponse`
Located at: `src/main/java/rpc/v1/netty/common/message`

- **`RpcRequest`**: Contains information about the method being invoked, including the interface name, method name, parameter types, and parameters.
- **`RpcResponse`**: Holds the result of the invoked method, including return data or an error message if an issue occurred.

#### 3.3 `NettyRpcServer`
Located at: `src/main/java/rpc/v1/netty/server/impl/NettyRpcServer.java`

The `NettyRpcServer` is the main server component. It uses:
- **Service Provider**: Manages available services by storing references to service implementations, allowing the server to locate and invoke the appropriate service.
- **Netty**: Manages client connections and handles network operations efficiently, with separate boss and worker thread groups.
- **Thread Pool**: Processes requests concurrently, managing resource use and enhancing scalability.

#### 3.4 `NettyServerHandler`
Located at: `src/main/java/rpc/v1/netty/server/netty/handler/NettyServerHandler.java`

The `NettyServerHandler`:
- Deserializes incoming `RpcRequest` objects.
- Uses reflection to invoke the appropriate service method.
- Packages the result in an `RpcResponse` object and sends it back to the client.

#### 3.5 Kryo Encoder and Decoder
Located at: `src/main/java/rpc/v1/netty/common/codec`

The custom **KryoEncoder** and **KryoDecoder** are responsible for:
- Serializing `RpcRequest` and `RpcResponse` objects using Kryo.
- Deserializing incoming requests and responses to enable seamless communication between client and server.

### 4. Workflow

The following steps outline the overall workflow in the NettyRPC framework:

1. **Client-Side Method Invocation**:
    - The client calls a method on a proxy object generated by `ClientProxy`. For example, `UserService proxy.getUserById(1);`.

2. **Client Proxy Interception**:
    - `ClientProxy` intercepts the call, creates an `RpcRequest`, and sends it to the server using Netty channels.

3. **Server Request Handling**:
    - `NettyRpcServer` accepts connections and processes requests using a thread pool. `NettyServerHandler` decodes the incoming request and forwards it to the appropriate service.

4. **Request Processing in `NettyServerHandler`**:
    - `NettyServerHandler` deserializes the `RpcRequest`, locates the target service, invokes the method, and prepares an `RpcResponse`.

5. **Response Transmission**:
    - The server serializes the `RpcResponse` using `KryoEncoder` and sends it back to the client over the Netty channel.

6. **Client Receives Result**:
    - The client proxy receives the `RpcResponse`, deserializes it, and returns the result to the caller as if it were a local method call.

### 5. Benefits of Using Netty and Kryo

The combination of Netty and Kryo provides the following advantages:

- **High Performance**: Netty’s non-blocking I/O and Kryo’s efficient serialization reduce latency and overhead.
- **Scalability**: Netty’s event-driven architecture allows the server to handle large numbers of concurrent connections efficiently.
- **Resource Management**: The thread pool limits the number of concurrent threads, reducing context-switching overhead and stabilizing resource use.
- **Improved Serialization**: Kryo’s serialization format is compact and fast, reducing the amount of data transmitted over the network.

### 6. Future Enhancements

To further enhance this RPC framework, consider adding the following features:

- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Implement load balancing to distribute requests across multiple server instances.
- **Service Discovery**: Introduce a service registry for clients to dynamically locate and connect to available services.
- **Error Handling and Retries**: Improve client resilience with automatic retries and error recovery mechanisms.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Add metrics for tracking request counts, response times, and resource usage to monitor server performance.
